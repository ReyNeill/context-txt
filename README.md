This is just a little script that lists all of your files inside of inside a directory to a single ```.txt``` file, which is the most efficient way I've seen of giving context to an LLM, skipping attachment file limits.

# How to use it
```
python3 content.py <folder_dir>
```

Note: You can skip folders you don't want to list as well
